    This is an example of how to use setup-finder to find multi-bag setups. Hopefully it is a good enough
    starting off point to apply to other problems.

    First we find first bag solutions, using sf.setup and a fumen input, then filter them using is_TSS.
    Later on, setup-finder will generate all possible TSS setups (or even have solutions pre-generated somewhere),
    so you won't have to manually create a fumen for each T position.

    Next, we import an overlay and find continuations for all the bag 1 setups we found.
    Eventually you'll be able to specify what you are trying to do in some sort of input file, and overlays
    will be able to be specified there in text form as below or in fumen form.
    Also, you should be able to generate Tspin/Tetris overlays to find all possible attacking continuations.

    Lastly, we find PCs and print results sorted by PC rate. Since PCs will always be the "end" of a setup
    in the sense that you end up with a blank field, they are treated differently than continuations.
    (Todo: For setups that start AFTER a PC in the middle of a bag, maybe I should have a setting to find these.)
    Later on, you should be able to find setups that don't end on a PC that are scored and sorted differently,
    for example by the success rate per piece sequence, or by the average key presses used. PCs should also be
    weighted based on what piece sequences they can be stacked by (or the minimum number of setups to learn to get
    the desired success rate.)
