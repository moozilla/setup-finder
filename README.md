# setup-finder

setup-finder is a tool for generating opening setups in Tetris. It leverages knewjade's solution-finder program to find setups that span multiple bags.

My goal is to be able to find any setups that fit a broad set of user-defined rules, but for now I am working on setups that start with a T-Spin and end in a Perfect Clear after 3 bags.
